I'm creating an daily meal delivery web application. 
1. There are 4 userstypes - End User, Resturent, Delivery boy, Admin.
2. Resturent will register and list it's daily menu for breakfast lunch and dinner. 
3. foreach day resturent can update it's menu availability.
4. When end user will open the site, by default he will be shown only the resturent located in 2km distance from user's current location.
5. then user will see resturent's menu and then order for food.
6. He can pay instantly online or cash on delivery.
7. User can set his monthly menu, like one can set his daily meal(lunch, dinner, brekfast) for next 30days(so that he doesn't need to order everyday).
8. The orders will be listed to specific resturent's dashboard(today's order list). When new order comes the order will be shown in real time in the list. 
9. Once the order is ready resturent will assign the the order to a delivery boy for delivery. 
10. In the delivery boy's dashboard he can only show the order item and delivery location.
11. once delivery boy delivered, will make it done.
Need suggestion.
For frontend I think nextjs is good. Now there are 4 frontend User Website, and Admin, Hotel and delivery panel(it will look same frontend).
And backend I decided one of these-  Fastapi.
